### Summary

Originally created for the admin team to keep track of all of the events and locations on the server, it went public after [a vote](https://discord.com/channels/969376256640569474/1075258825252278272/1128968326706643014) was held on the discord that kept it open. The wiki has had its ups and downs, The wiki page on the Final Republic Website was created originally by [@OusmBlueNinja](#ousmblueninja), a developer on our team, then later forked off to make a new website by [@DJzombiehunter](#djzombiehunter).

### Usage

Its supposed to be quite simple, use the filters you like, or search up stuff manually, and voila, wiki pages galore.

### Editing Guidlines

There aren't really any major rules, these are just suggestions to make everything consistent across the wiki. Doesnt really matter if you follow them to the letter, but these rules are flexible as it is so it doesnt really matter.

*   Pages are to be written in Markdown, and are filtered for anything malicious after they are sent to the website.
*   If you need to add any JS in to an article, please contact someone higher-up on the Development team and they will help you.
*   If you cant/down know how to write in Markdown, just let someone on the Discord know and they should be able to help you. Considering Discord uses Markdown as its main formatting, you should learn it asap
*   Please, **do not**, use any AI for any articles. I have attempted to use it before and it either gets facts wrong, is filled with jargon (that i had to look up lol), or sounds like a advert from Apple with how condescending it sounds. Plus the legal aspect of using it for this; just don't please.
*   Bottom line; this page is supposed to be easily understandable by everyone, even people with a very limited grasp of English, so don't write like a lawyer, just write how you're talking to a friend or parents.
