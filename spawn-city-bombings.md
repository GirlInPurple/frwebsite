### Description

The main city, Spawn City, was bombed multiple times in the span of around a month. This string of events is considered the beginning of the [The Great Escalation](great-escalation), but is listed under another name due to its effects on Spawn City months after the events transpired.  
  
Alot of the info on this article is either vague due to no information, or intentionally left out to not provoke a second spree. Please do not bother anyone involved in this event for any reason, it has been months since this occurred and many of the greifers have apologized to me for these events. This article is for record-keeping purposes only.

### Trivia

*   A total of 6 backups were restored at this time
*   The only place that had no concern of being hit was Spawn City North Station, with the closest bombing occurring at the PVP Arena, ~150 blocks away. This is partly due to the fact this was the farthest FRTA station from any major builds at the time.

" Dedek\_medvedek, an old member from when the server first started, and was part of the spawn city bombings, griefed spawn. Thankfully only light damage, but it revealed an issue with the tnt detection system. I dont want to disable it cause farms can use tnt dupers, but if need be we will.
