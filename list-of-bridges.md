The following is a list of all the bridges on the server, along with a short paragraph describing them.

### Vales Memorial Bridge

The first bridge constructed on the server. Based off a bridge from an old server called No Mas Pantalones. An FRTA Metro line used to pass through the lower section of the bridge, but has since been abandoned. Currently, there is a plan to expand Road 2 to cross the bridge, but it has been postponed.

### Sine Bridge

Named after the shape the supports make, Sine Bridge is the most used, and greifed, bridge on the server. Road 1 crosses it on its way into downtown Spawn City, and this has caused it to become a target for many attacks. It was one of the most hit locations during the [Spawn City Bombings](#spawn-city-bombings).

### Blueberry and Rapsberry Bridges

Named after the color of the two bridges, Blueberry and Rapsberry Bridges are opposites in every way (except being bridges). Rapsberry Bridge carries Road 1 between Below The Bedrock and the Borderlands, while Blueberry bridge does the same, except it goes to Cublak View and Yuri's Town.

### Castiela Memorial Bridge

Based off Skyarrow Bridge from Pokemon Black/White, spanning between Castiela City and Pinwheel Forest. Skyarrow Bridge is based off of the Brooklyn Bridge in New York City, as the region of Unova is based off New York, New Jersey, and southern Connecticut. As of writing this article (Sept 17th, 2023), construction on the final bridge has not started. The bridge is currently a scaffolding-based temporary bridge created for Road 1 to cross the valley.

### [MinervaKirei's](#minervakirei) Bridge

A small bridge carrying Road 1 between Below The Bedrock and Kirei's Town. It is on the northern end of Road 1 and is completely made out of jungle wood. Due to Kirei being banned, the users of this bridge are almost non-existent, being only the remaining members of Kirei's town and Kwazii Penninsula, plus some travelers.
