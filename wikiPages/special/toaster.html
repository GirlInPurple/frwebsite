<h2>Toasters</h2>
<p>
    A toaster is a small electric appliance that uses radiant heat to brown sliced bread into toast.
</p>
<h3>Types</h3>
<h4>Pop-up toaster</h4>
Glowing filaments of a modern 2-slice toaster
In pop-up or automatic toasters, a single vertical piece of bread is dropped into a slot on the top of the toaster. A lever on the side of the toaster is pressed down, lowering the bread into the toaster and activating the heating elements. The length of the toasting cycle (and therefore the degree of toasting) is adjustable via a lever, knob, or series of pushbuttons, and when an internal device determines that the toasting cycle is complete, the toaster turns off and the toast pops up out of the slots.
The completion of toasting may be determined by a timer or by a thermal sensor, such as a bimetallic strip, located close to the toast.[citation needed]
Toasters may also be used to toast other foods such as teacakes, toaster pastry, potato waffles and crumpets, though the resultant accumulation of fat and sugar inside the toaster can contribute to its eventual failure.
Among pop-up toasters, those toasting two slices of bread are more purchased than those which can toast four.[1] Pop-up toasters can have a range of appearances beyond just a square box and may have an exterior finish of chrome, copper, brushed metal, or any color plastic.[1] The marketing and price of toasters may not be an indication of quality for producing good toast.[1] A typical modern two-slice pop-up toaster can draw from 600 to 1200 watts.[2]
Beyond the basic toasting function, some pop-up toasters offer additional features such as:
One-sided toasting, which some people prefer when toasting bagels
The ability to power the heat elements in only one of the toaster's several slots
Slots of various depths, lengths, and widths to accommodate a variety of bread types
Provisions to allow the bread to be lifted higher than the normal raised position, so toast that has shifted during the toasting process can safely and easily be removed
