### Names

This town was known under 3 different names, here they are listed;

*   **Ocean Plains:** This was the name of the canceled FRTA Metro Station to go to this area; it has since become the common name for this region. It was supposed to be the second station on what was then the Mushroom Line but now would be on the Spruce Line.
*   **Golden Bay City:** The original name of the city, the town being meant to be the richest and most prosperous town on the server.
*   **Golden Knights Castle:** The name of the only remaining building residing in its borders, the ruins of the old castle of the Golden Knights.

### History

**Construction:** Sometime in Early May 2023, [@DJzombiehunter](#djzombiehunter) and [@RainForCraft](#rainforcraft) started construction on the castle for a failed group called The Golden Knights.

**Deconstruction:** Due to @RainForCraft leaving the server, possibly permanently, @DJzombiehunter and @RainForCraft blew up a good portion of the base.

**Revival:** @ToxicTrapper has expressed interest in gaining ownership of this base, and it will be granted whenever he is ready.
