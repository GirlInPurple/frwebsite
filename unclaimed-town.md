### Summary

A trapped village with no villagers left, some spare supplies, and redstone scattered around, all built in a giant chasm just NE of Spawn City.

### Members

The thing is, no players have logged out or said to have owned this base, it is a complete mystery as to who owns this place. There was a post made on the wiki back on July 9th, 2023 asking for someone to claim the town, if not for to keep it, only for historical reasons. Nobody has claimed the town since, and a deal was made that it will go up for auction on July 9th 2024 to the highest bidder.
