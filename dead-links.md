If you've gotten here, you got here in two ways;

- Clicked a Dead Link,
- or Encountered an error while trying to load a wiki page.

You may leave this article at any time by clicking the "Return back to the Wiki" text above.

### Options 1: Dead Link Error
Here is a basic explanation of a Dead Link;

HTML runs on Tags "`<p></p>`", with Values "`id="Example"`";

`<p id="Example>This is a Paragraph tag, or "p" for short, with the "id" Value of "Example"</p>`

What you have encountered is something called a Dead Link, a `<a>` (a link tag) with an invalid `href` value (where you're supposed to go). 
They are colored <a style="color: rgb(256, 64, 64);">red</a> on this wiki.

There are quite a few Dead Links on this wiki, most of them being either Players or articles that are in the works.
That doesnt mean Dead Links are bad though, it just means there is more work to be done.

Below is a list of all the Dead Links with highest priority for writing. Ask around the Discord if you want to help with a page;

*   [@bmbxbby](#bmbxbby)
*   [The Borderlands](#the-borderlands)
*   [World Origin Road](#world-origin-road)
*   [Spawn City](#spawn-city)
*   [@ItSameGaming](#itsamegaming)
*   [@lionking234578](#lionking)

Here is an image of what the console should say if you clicked a Dead Link;
![Console, Dead Link](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1061516148325220455/1171168493287256114/image.png?ex=655bb2a8&is=65493da8&hm=c792100136cdfe7270aac236f1a0ede67b865c99ecd4d2e18947c52655be54fb&)
It is caused by trying to edit a variable that is not pointing at an existing HTML tag, or in this case an Anchor Element, or as mentioned earlier, an `<a>` tag.

Note: a "Tag" is what a single HTML line on its own is called, an "Element" is what is displayed on the screen.

### Option 2: Unaccounted Error

If you didnt click a Dead Link, and weren't messing with the site using the dev tools (the "F12" key on most Chromium based browsers), then you've hit something that wasnt accounted for.

I urge you to press F12 and send a screenshot of the "Console" and "Issues" section of the dev tools in the wiki-discussion channel on our Discord. If there are too many errors, send multiple screenshots.
