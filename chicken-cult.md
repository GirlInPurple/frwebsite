# Summary
Originally created by [@RainForCraft](#rainforcraft), [@DJzombiehunter](#djzombiehunter), and [@ItSameGaming](#itsamegaming), the Chicken Cult was formed out of a joke where a few of us got our hands on chicken heads and made a cult out of it. It was originally formed in the city of [Below The Bedrock](#below-the-bedrock), but has since expanded to [Spawn City](#spawn-city) and [Rain's Unnamed Town](#rain-unnamed-town). Due to [@ItSameGaming](#itsamegaming) and [@RainForCraft](#rainforcraft) quitting the server, the cult has all but disbanded.  
There is nothing else to explain really, just really obscure lore.
