[@bmbxbby](#bmbxbby) is the longest running player in all of Final Republic and FR adjacent history, playing every season of SouthCraft, both seasons of FR, and almost every offshoot of the two that has been ran. In fact, he still plays to this day, and even created [Communist Island](#communist-island), a small island town just on the border of the [Spawn City Metropolitan Area](#greater-spawn-city-metro). While he hasn't logged on much in recent months, some fo the admins still have contact with them outside the game, and is doing well last time we talked.

### Trivia

*   He was the one who told [@DJzombiehunter](#djzombiehunter) about [AdaxJosue's Map Triangluation Method](map-triangulation), and the reason why so much of the Southcraft Era was documented at all. He was one of the first wiki contributors and still occasionally contributes when he can.
  
*   His username is "boomboxbaby" with all the vowels removed, most people call him "b-m-b-x-b-b-y" instead.
