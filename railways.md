#### [@BredTalk](#bredtalk)'s Personal Line

_mostly dismantled after the [Spawn City Bombings](spawn-city-bombings)_

After the Bombings, [@RainForCraft](#rainforcraft) blew up [@BredTalk](#bredtalk)'s base, and the line was cleaned up afterwards by [@DJzombiehunter](#djzombiehunter).  
You can still see the remains of the line in the North-Western corner of Spawn City, a few random redstone torches and a line going under the river. This segment of rail is slated to be turned into a section of the Spawn City LRT.

### Final Republic Transportation Authority

Moved to [FRTA](#frta).

#### [@Guccimanoff](#guccimanoff)'s' Personal Line

_dismantled after the [Spawn City Bombings](spawn-city-bombings)_

A simple train line going from [@Guccimanoff](#guccimanoff)'s base to Central Station, passing through Squeezaltopia and the river before ending next the Central Station.  
There was a plan to bring this line back using the Derevo Line, that plan was morphed into the Spawn City LRT Line.

#### Railway to [Rain City](#rain-city)

A railway made by [@lionking234578](#lionking234578), [@lazy_daisy_uwu](#lazydaisyuwu), and [@DJzombiehunter](#djzombiehunter). It was built by them so people had a slightly faster route between the two cities, as an FRTA Oak Line connection to [Rain City](#rain-city) was denied. The line has since fallen into disrepair after the abandoning of [Rain City](#rain-city).

#### Railway to [Below The Bedrock](#below-the-bedrock)

A railway built by [@ItSameGaming](#itsamegaming) when they joined the server. It has gone unused since they left.
