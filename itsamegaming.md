ItSameGaming was one of many players to build a town on the server, specifically the town of [Below The Bedrock](#below-the-bedrock). Now, you might wonder what about them is so important that they deserve their own wiki article?

### Building BTB

They're a very influential player due to the fact they built one of the largest towns on the server; Below The Bedrock is the 3rd largest town by land area, and 6th by build count. Now that alone doesnt do much, but with the fact they just... gave it away for free? to anyone who wants it? its unreal.

### Leaving Final Republic

They left because they simply did not have time or patience for playing or the server drama; and honestly, I would do it too.
