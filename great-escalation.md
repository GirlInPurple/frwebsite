# [The Great Escalation]()
___Tags: ___

### Introduction

Directly after the [Spawn City Bombings](#spawn-city-bombings), with a bit of overlap during June 2023, a few of the largest towns got into some light drama, never breaking out into a war but constantly escalating, hence the name.

### Republica

The towns allied with the moderation team, usually containing a member of said team. The name is unofficial and only used in the wiki for record-keeping and simplicity.

#### Spawn Lavacast

2 lavacasts were made in Spawn City and discovered on 04/07/23, one was small and the other was go big we named it. Both are part of the Magmososa Mountain Range. To this day it is unknown who or why someone made the lavacast. The only buildings damaged were [@Tony142612736](#tony142)'s bunker/house and [@bmbxbby](#bmbxbby)'s bunker.

#### [@MinervaKirei](#minervak) Banned

Kirei tried to steal items out of [@lazy\_daisy\_uwu](#lazydaisyuwu)'s and [@RainForCraft](#rainforcraft)'s bases, and as per the rules Kirei was sent to the gulag and forced to pay for his actions. It started a server-wide drama over what the rules are and how everything is set up on the discord, mostly around the weird naming scheme of the channels at the time. It also re-kindled the conflict between [@RainForCraft](#rainforcraft) and [@MinervaKirei](#minervak). The end of it [@MinervaKirei](#minervak) was temp-banned for an unspecfied amount of time and all of the channels were renamed to reduced confusion.  
  
2 deaths were counted at the end of this conflict. [@DJzombiehunter](#djzombiehunter) and [@MinervaKirei](#minervak)'s Skeleton Horse.

#### This Conflict's End

Considering that [@RainForCraft](#rainforcraft) and [@ItSameGaming](#itsamegaming) quit the server, plus [@MinervaKirei](#minervak) being forced to pay for thier actions, it seems like war is highly unlikley.
