# [CaveTown](#cavetown)
___Tags: ___

_Not to be confused with [New CaveTown](#new-cavetown) or [CaveTown Thuhai](#second-cavetown)_

### Inhabitants

All but two players on the server lived in this town, the excluded are [@tacco2009](#tacco2009) and [@squeezal](#squeezal). The total population peaked at 4, with [@DJzombiehunter](#djzombiehunter), [@TipDuy3010](#tipduy3010), [@TrefleCrystal](#treflecrystal), and [@zacrny](#zacrny) all living in the cave.

### Location and Surrounding Regions

CaveTown is, unironically, built almost entirely in a cave, with only a small map wall, a single house, and ~0.2km of paths outside of said cave. The cave is a lush cave, around 40 blocks deep near city center and 50 blocks deep at the lowest. The surrounding regions are a snowy, regular taiga, and massive iceberg biome just off the coast.

### Structures

*   A stone pillar was turned into a massive tower for [@zacrny](#zacrny) to build a secret base inside of. It later became a storage room.
*   A small farming house towards the top of the cave, as it was the first house it is the most built up out of all of them.

### Trivia

*   The term "DevilTown is best" comes from a sign at the very front staircase in the center of the town. The whole naming scheme of the town is based on [Cavetown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavetown), an indie band.
*   A carbon copy of the town was planned to be built in Spawn City, and was around 10% finished. When Spawn City was blown up, a good majority of the entrance was blown up as well. Building has since then ceased and has become a district in Spawn City. Instead, a new project, coined [CaveTown Thuhai](#second-cavetown) has taken its place.
*   The story behind CaveTown is simple; [@DJzombiehunter](#djzombiehunter) found a cave near spawn, made a small stone building, and everyone (except 2) followed.
