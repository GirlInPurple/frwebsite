### Description

At the South-Western of the Oak Line lies a fully complete recreation of Final Republic Season 1's Cavetown.  
At least, it will be once its finished building. This isnt even the first time there has been an attempt to recreate it, as [New CaveTown](#new-cavetown) was the first attempt at it, and is now completely covered up by the CaveTown District of Spawn City.
