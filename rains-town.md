### Trivia

*   [@RainForCraft](#rainforcraft) at one point gave vauge threats about destroying the whole of the town because he was quitting and didnt want anyone to use it as a base, eventually he stopped threatening it and is instead joining back once again.
*   Rain's Town is occasionally called "Rain City" on road signs. The reason for this specific signage is lost to time, but tradition is upheld and all road signs use this name instead.
