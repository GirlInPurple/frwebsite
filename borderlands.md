# [The Borderlands](#borderlands)
___Tags: ___

### Summary

The Borderlands between Spawn City and Cublak View, are an almost completely unpopulated region just north of the city. It contains a few buildings and the Twin Berry Bridges, Cranberry Bridge having Roads 1 and 4 cross it, and Blueberry Bridge having only Road 4 cross it. The top of the hill near the Spawn City-Borderlands border is constantly covered with animals due to how the server optimizations effect mob pathfinding, always wanting to go up hills, not down them. The Borderlands can also be considered one of the oldest towns on the server, construction having started just before Nether Bay, the second oldest town on the server, only behind Spawn City. The only thing holding it back from the second oldest town was not having a permanent population until fairly recently.
