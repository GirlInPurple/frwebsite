### Trivia

*   The original spelling of the name is "finalrepublic" but spelling it "final republic" is perfectly fine as people will get what you're saying.
*   The game series Final Fantasy was made as Square Enix's final attempt at a popular game, and managed to make it work. Final Republic's name is for a similar reason, this was intended to be my last fully public server before closing it all down, and then the server exploded in popularity, causing the whole of FR S2 to set into motion.
*   The following is the oldest surviving screenshot of this server's world: ![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1061516148325220455/1133123214017564824/2023-01-14_14.png)
