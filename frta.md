### Summary

The FRTA, or Final Republic Transportation Authority, is a server-wide group based around transit. 6 highways and even more train lines are owned by the FRTA, keeping them as functional as possible, along with building more to connect builds to each other.

### Events

#### Line Merger

To keep the system as simple as possible for people who might not understand how it works and to rebuild Central Station as a passthrough instead of a stopping point, we've merged a few lines together.

*   The Mushroom line between Central Station and Spawn City Farming District has been merged with the Oak Line. The Oak line now goes between Vrynn Harbor and Below The bedrock.
*   The Derevo Line has been rebrand into the Spawn City LRT, as well as plans for an above ground section of Gare de l'origine.
*   The Manegrove line continues past Central Station towards Jungle Depot, creating a new station, Jungle Depot West. It then continues to the world border.
*   Because of the new Jungle Depot west station, Jungle Depot has been rebrand to Jungle Depot East.

### A list of all the roads on the server (in order of construction)

#### Road 2

The first road in the Network, stretching from [Sine Bridge](bridges) in [Spawn City](spawn-city) to [World Origin Road Station](world-orign-road). It is by far the shortest road in the network, only closely followed by roads 4 and 6.

#### Road 1

This time, the longest road in the network, stretching between Kwazii Peninsula and Rain City, passing by large towns like Below The Bedrock, Cublak View, Spawn City, and Vrynn Harbor. Construction completed sometime around July 14th 2023 with the completion of the Vrynn Harbor Bridge.

#### Road 4

Road 4 is the most out-of-the-way out of all of them, passing through only 3 towns total and paralleling Road 1, just farther north and ending on the coast of the Northwegian Sea. There is nothing to say other than Road 4 is the only road with localized road signs, being in Portuguese.

#### Road 3

The loneliest road so far, only hitting 2 towns, Rain's Town and Vyrnn Harbor. The section between Vrynn and the Windswept Sea is almost complete, but it is slated to go all the way down to Nether Bay and up to Baystone. A large section of it also overlaps with Road 6, between Vrynn Harbor and Key Island Bridges.

#### Road 5

A pretty lonely road, like Road 3, but it has a train line paralleling it for a good portion of the journey,

### A list of all the Metro/Railway lines on the server (in order of construction)

#### Oak Line

The first metro line, specifically the segment between Gare de l'orgine and Central Station. It was originally meant ot have far more stations than it currently does in the Spawn City region, one where the Spawn City Lavacast is and one in The Borderlands. It is also the most used line, being the oldest and most built around out of all of them.

#### Jungle Line

A high speed line serving as an express line for the Oak Line between Central Station and Jungle Depot East. It later connects up to 2 more stations, being a connection with the Manegrove line and ending above Windswept's Guardian Farm. This line took the most time to build out of all of them due to having to clear space under Spawn City, a heavily built up region. You wouldn't believe how many tunnels i had to dodge while digging it out. This line also uses the Vales Memorial Bridge as a tunnel across the river.

#### Mangrove Line

The longest line out of all of them, stopping at both the Southern and Northern world borders. It also crosses with every other train line at least once, and half the roads on the map too. The ones it misses are Roads 2, 3, and 6. This large extent also gives it the ability to connect literally everything together, hop on a train in DuyTip Industrial and you can get to Kwazii Penninsula in around 10 minutes, a journey of around 4.5km and would take almost 20 minutes just walking.

#### Spruce Line

The Northern East-West counterpart to the Mangrove line, touching the North-Western world border and multiple towns along the way.

#### Crimson Line

The East-West counterpart to the Mangrove line, similar to the Spruce line, but going all the way across the map, hitting large towns like DuyTip Industrial and Windswept Fang along the way.

#### Mushroom Line

A line lost to time, as construction has ceased and has merged with the Oak line. A new Mushroom Line was planned to go between Vrynn Harbor and Nether Bay, crossing paths with the Crimson and Oak Lines, but it never came to fruition.

### Trivia

*   The only building to not be blow up in Spawn City during the Spawn City Bombings is Spawn City North Station.
*   The FRTA almost built a highway system similar to the American Highway System, with elevated roads and horse depots along it. This was canceled because of a lack of materials, lack of space in Spawn City for a loop road, and it would destroy quite a few builds. This was eventually morphed into the Roadway system we have today.
*   The FRTA is known under 2 names; "Final Republic Transportation Authority" and "Final Republic Transportation Association". They are basically the same thing and are freely interchangeable.
