### Origin

Not entirely sure on the origin, but there are a few options on where it came from:

*   r/Minecraft or r/MCPE on reddit, and just traveling by words from there
*   [@bmbxbby](#bmbxbby) telling me about it at some point
*   having a map open while exploring and finding it by accident

I legitimately have no clue where this came from, all i know is that it was used heavily in SC Season 4 and 5. These are just some ideas.

### Usage

This technique requires multiple maps, somewhere in the 5 to 64 range, and can be used tp locate any player on Bedrock edition. Although, there is a downside to this technique, while its accurate nearly to the block, its exponentially time and resource consuming by distance

### Instructions

*   First, open a map anywhere in the world (see image 1)
*   If the player is on the side of the map, go towards them, while opening more maps as you go so they're not underground (see image 2)
*   If the player icon is in the corner, go in either of the directions they are touching until step 2 is met (see image 1)
*   Depending on the level of map you will get a location accurate to the block (see image 3)
*   You should be able to find them nearby, just go to where they are on the map and look around, maybe go up or down if necessary (see last/unmarked image)
