### Trivia

*   The name "Baystone" is pronounced "Be-Stone," reflecting its blend of beta-style builds and pixel art popular during the 2010-2014 era.
*   Baystone is not the first town in the Northwest, as it is near [XsElite's Town](#xselites-town), the true first town in the Northwest quadrant.
