### Trivia

*   The [Chimken Cult](#chicken-cult) was formed after [@RainForCraft](#rainforcraft) [@DJzombiehunter](#djzombiehunter) and [@ItSameGaming](itsamegaming) all wore chicken heads that were obtained from a chicken farm in the city. I recommend you dont question in, if only for your sanity.
*   The cities only shop (and one of the very few builds at all) was moved to [Vrynn Harbor](#vrynn-harbor) after [@lionking234578](#lionking) took over.
*   This city did not have a wiki page on the Discord until after the new owner, [@lionking234578](#lionking) took over. Conversly, this cities artivle was one of the first to be moved over to the website due to alphabetical order.
