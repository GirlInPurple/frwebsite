Below The Bedrock tags:Location2023EnglishOusmBlueNinjaDJzombiehunter Summary @ItSameGaming created the town shortly after joining. They then left to join another server after around a week of playtime. They left behind their old gear in a chest labelled for new players only, then left the discord and minecraft servers, never to join again. Residents @ItSameGaming (Founder / Ex-Leader) @lionking234578 (Current Leader) Images, Maps, and References No maps, images, or other data has been collected as of now. Please submit any you have. Xaero's Worldmap screenshots highly sought after. Trivia The Chimken Cult was formed after @RainForCraft @DJzombiehunter and @ItSameGaming all wore chicken heads that were obtained from a chicken farm in the city. I recommend you dont question in, if only for your sanity. The cities only shop (and one of the very few builds at all) was moved to Vrynn Harbor after @lionking234578 took over. This city did not have a wiki page on the Discord until after the new owner, @lionking234578 took over. Conversly, this cities article was one of the first to be moved over to the website due to alphabetical order.
