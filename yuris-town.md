### Summary

A few buildings and a chest-monster just north-west of Spawn City, with a road connection to Cublak View. A Road 4 connection was planned far in advance to go to that location before the location was claimed by [@Yuri\_z759](#yuri_z), the date of which that happened is unknown. It is also located near Ocean Plains, an abandoned castle on the coast of the main ocean. Ocean Plains has no historical or physical conections to this town.
